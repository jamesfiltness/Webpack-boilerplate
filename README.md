## ES6, React, Webpack boilerplate

This is a minimal boilerplate to help get up and running quickly with React and es6 running on webpack.

Pull the repo and then run `npm install` followed by `npm start`. This will kick a webpack dev server off, available at:

```
http://localhost:1111/
http://localhost:1111/webpack-dev-server/bundle
```
